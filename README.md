### 📌 What is this?

**AI Doctor Agent** is an intelligent, AI-powered web app that analyzes medical images (X-ray, MRI, CT, Ultrasound, etc.) and returns structured, research-backed diagnostic reports — instantly.

Built for medical professionals, students, and the curious, this tool harnesses the power of **Google's Gemini AI** and real-time web search to provide not just a diagnosis, but also clear explanations and relevant medical references.

### 🧠 What it does

When you upload a radiological image, the app:

1. **Detects** the type of image and body region
2. **Analyzes** it for abnormalities and measurements
3. **Generates** a diagnostic assessment with confidence levels
4. **Explains** everything in simple, patient-friendly language
5. **Supports** findings with recent research via live search

No jargon, no ambiguity — just AI-assisted clarity and insight.
